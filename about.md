#### Colophon

This site (blog) is a place I share my thoughts, opinions, reviews, some ideas, projects or findings. This site is built with the excellent [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator and proudly hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The layout of this site (Jekyll theme) is designed from scratch and hand-made by me with a passion of simplicity. The typeface is powered by [Fira](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) from Mozilla. The [source code](http://github.com/heiswayi/heiswayi.github.io) can be found on my GitHub repositories.

The following links are the **dedicated site** for listing of my GitHub repositories and gists:-

- [heiswayi.github.repositories](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-repos/)
- [heiswayi.github.gists](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-gists/)
